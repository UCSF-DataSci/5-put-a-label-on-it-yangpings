# Assignment 5: Health Data Classification Results

This file contains your manual interpretations and analysis of the model results from the different parts of the assignment.

## Part 1: Logistic Regression on Imbalanced Data

### Interpretation of Results

In this section, provide your interpretation of the Logistic Regression model's performance on the imbalanced dataset. Consider:

- Which metric performed best and why?
- Which metric performed worst and why?
- How much did the class imbalance affect the results?
- What does the confusion matrix tell you about the model's predictions?

## Part 2: Tree-Based Models with Time Series Features

### Comparison of Random Forest and XGBoost

In this section, compare the performance of the Random Forest and XGBoost models:

- Which model performed better according to AUC score?
- Why might one model outperform the other on this dataset?
- How did the addition of time-series features (rolling mean and standard deviation) affect model performance?

## Part 3: Logistic Regression with Balanced Data

### Improvement Analysis

In this section, analyze the improvements gained by addressing class imbalance:

- Which metrics showed the most significant improvement?
- Which metrics showed the least improvement?
- Why might some metrics improve more than others?
- What does this tell you about the importance of addressing class imbalance?
